This GitHub repo contains examples and code for a visualization technique where formant trajectory dynamics are represented in a 2D vowel space (the basic plot type is static, but velocity through vowel formant space is encoded as a visual parameter). 

These plots are built in R using `ggplot`. They can also be animated as .mp4s with or without accompanying synced .wav audio in R using the `gganimate` and `av` packages. Data and code are provided for two sets of plots:


1) A young (~20yo) male speaker from Indiana producing b_d words (e.g. *bead*, *bode*, *bid*, etc). Words were read, three repetitions total for each word. Recorded January, 2022.


2) An animation of a vocalization that Stefon Flego attempted to produce in the hopes that its formant trajectory would trace a heart <3 in vowel space. Recorded May, 2025.

There are also folders with recent posters that have used this technique-- one for NZ English (ASA 2025), and one for modern Icelandic.
